# AITXhackathon
in July 2024, our team of four friends set off to Austin for an exciting AI hackathon. Tasked with developing a predictive model, we dove into creating a Random Forest algorithm designed to forecast the World Cup winner. After days of coding, analyzing data, and refining our model, we presented our solution with great enthusiasm. Our innovative approach combined statistical rigor with cutting-edge machine learning techniques, showcasing our skills and teamwork. Although we didnâ€™t take home the top prize, the experience was a thrilling blend of camaraderie and competition.
